            <description><![CDATA[<p>Web Components have been an controversial subject that surfaced the Front end world over the last years that I&#39;m still pretty skeptical about its usage on existing and greenfield projects due the lack of good examples on how they can be rolled out to production, but there is sure a way to get started with them without buying in all the hype.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Sebastian attended to the first ever Polymer Summit in Amsterdam recently. This was his first Polymer conference obviously but this was also his first conference &amp; trip to Amsterdam. As an AngularJS developer he was very curious about the Polymer Project and the ambitious ideas behind it. Here is what he had to say.

            <title><![CDATA[Quick Trick: Using Template to Delay Loading of Images]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to newer elements to play with there are a few that are slightly odd. Canvas is one of them, as it doesn’t do anything without scripting. It is a placeholder for a canvas painting or animation and can contain fallback content when it is not supported. Template is another such element that needs to be addressed in this way.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What happened to Web Components?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago, there was a lot of excitement surrounding Web Components: everybody talked about them, the frameworks Ember and Angular planned to integrate them or even be based on them, etc.</p>
<p>By now, that excitement seems to have died down. This blog post examines what happened to Web Components. Spoiler: they are alive and well and slowly being adopted across browsers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Taming Polymer with SystemJS and TypeScript, part 1]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Web Components are awesome for building web apps out of interoperable widgets. They’re made out of 4 technologies which
Polymer 1.0 brings to all major web browsers using polyfills. However one of them, HTML Imports, is so problematic that
Mozilla refuses to implement it natively. Let’s work around it using SystemJS and discover a whole new and (in my opinion)
nicer way of working with Polymer!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the front-end world, testing is a weird topic. Developers know how much testing is important, but lots of them don’t
embrace this practice. This is because testing is often perceived as a time consuming and a difficult task.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Building a realtime collaborative to-do application, where task status is synced in realtime across all connected devices as their state is changed can be a difficult thing to manage. Using Polymer an PubNub to build a collaborative application enables users to receive updates between connected devices, and to sync state.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Update on standardizing Shadow DOM and Custom Elements]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>There has been revived interest in standardizing shadow DOM and custom elements across all browsers. To that end we had a bunch of discussion online, met in April to discuss shadow DOM, and met earlier this month to discuss custom elements. There is agreement around shadow DOM now. <code>host.attachShadow()</code> will give you a <code>ShadowRoot</code> instance. And <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> elements can be used to populate the shadow tree with children from the host.</p>
